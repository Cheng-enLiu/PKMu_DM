Fitting code used to produce Figure 3 in the paper.

air_hist0714.c – Code for obtaining the particle composition fractions before and after the initial fit.

air_hist_copy.c – Code for estimating the systematic uncertainty of the fitting method by varying conditions (e.g., angular range, detector volume, and other fraction).

air_hist0721 – Code for plotting Figure 3 in the paper using the composition fractions obtained above.

toy_mc_template_fit_with_fixed_other.c – Fitting code with the other fraction fixed.

toy_mc_template_fit_with_floating_other.c – Fitting code with all composition fractions allowed to float.
